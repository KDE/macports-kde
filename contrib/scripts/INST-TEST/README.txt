These scripts are only kept at this location for
historical reasons, as it makes more sense on MacPorts
to create ports for all projects distributed for KF5
and its libraries and applications, which is still to
be done.

The scripts in INST-TEST were just a quick-and-dirty hack
to allow for an in-system-installation of KF5 and apps
for testing purposes.

The real stuff has been moved away from this repository
to the 'mp-osx-ci' branch of the mp-osx-ci repository [1]
which is a clone of websites/build-kde-org.

Please do not use these scripts, unless you're really
sure that you indeed want to do so! :)
