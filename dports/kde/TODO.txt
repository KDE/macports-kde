Main toolbar rendering:

All applications need quite a while to update the rendering of the main
toolbar. The symptoms are: (a) sometimes the toolbar shows some colored
garbage and (b) often the toolbar appears to be enlarged, i.e. stretched
horizontally, up to a certain moment, then all appears as expected.

--------------------------[ Notes ]----------------------------------------------------

kate
- has illigebly small controls in "Search & Replace" widget in "Macintosh (aqua)" theme


kgoldrunner
- stops with "Get Folders" in title of main window
- menu bar stays without items
- closing the empty error dialog leads to opening the main window
- only now there's a fully functional application


kcalc
- drawing issues, perhaps due to theming (status bar overlaps with buttons)
- buttons overlap with themselves


kreversi
- shows dialog at start with illegible content


ktouch
- shows only empty window


parley
- crashed when trying to create a new collection


kig
- toolbar on the left doesn't display the expected graphic-buttons
- crashed when changing style while the app is running


kigo
- needs a go engine installed


cantor
- shows an empty dialog box at the start, which needs to be close to go on
- application seems to work, but is empty, as no supported math apps are found


kompare
- starts with empty window
- no menu items


rocs
- seems to start normally
- but crashes at program end


kruler
- doesn't redraw properly when moving ruler around and hovering mouse over it


blogilo
- starts with error, since DB driver can't be loaded


karm
- shows empty error message (like kgoldrunner)
- title or error dialog says (expectedly) that "karm is now ktimetracker"


ktimetracker
- fails to create part


kfloppy
- display issues with overlapping texts in main dialog


kstars
- does not have a program icon in launchpad
- crashes at startup
