This list is NOT complete. I have done only some basic test, like starting
the apps and checking that their menus exists, etc.

Please support us getting this tested more throughly!

The issues found won't delay the release of KDE 4.13.3 on MacPorts,
as some of these might already be fixed in KDE 4.14...

Main toolbar rendering:

At least on my Parallels 9 virtual machine many applications sometimes
need quite a while to update the rendering of the main toolbar.

The symptoms are:

 (a) sometimes the toolbar shows some colored garbage
 (b) often the toolbar appears to be enlarged, i.e. stretched
     horizontally, up to a certain moment, then all appears as expected.

This doesn't seem to happen for RenÃ© though.

--------------------------[ Notes ]----------------------------------------------------

konqueror
- just starting and immediately closing the app already leads to a crash
- trying to access a website when its running also ltriggers crash
- app always starts with a far too wide window reaching out of the screen size


kate
- has illigebly small controls in "Search & Replace" widget in "Macintosh (aqua)" theme
- problem with "clean indentation" feature -> https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=339676
- also a theme issue -> https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=333393
- re app icon -> https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=333050

kgoldrunner
- stops with "Get Folders" in title of main window
- menu bar stays without items
- closing the empty error dialog leads to opening the main window
- only now there's a fully functional application


kcalc
- drawing issues due to theming (status bar overlaps with buttons)
- buttons overlap with themselves
- happens only for default "Macintosh (aqua)" theme
- see b.k.o. ticket https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=339670


kreversi
- shows dialog at start with illegible content


ktouch
- shows only empty main window, no menu items created


parley
- crashed when trying to create a new collection


kig
- toolbar on the left doesn't display the expected graphic-buttons
- crashed when changing style while the app is running


kigo
- needs a go engine installed
- installing gnugo port doesn't help, as the kigo hangs


cantor
- shows an empty dialog box at the start, which needs to be close to go on
- application seems to work, but is empty, as no supported math apps are found
- at another try even shows an error message in its main window re "no backend found"


kompare
- starts with empty error dialog and aborts


rocs
- seems to start normally
- but crashes at program end


kruler
- doesn't redraw properly when moving ruler around and hovering mouse over it


blogilo
- starts with error, since DB driver can't be loaded


karm
- shows empty error message (like kgoldrunner)
- title or error dialog says (expectedly) that "karm is now ktimetracker"


ktimetracker
- fails to create part


kfloppy
- display issues with overlapping texts in main dialog


kstars
- does not have a program icon in launchpad
- crashes at startup


palapeli
- does not show the images of the various puzzles in the collection
- also no image in the floating previewer
- is this connected to me running the debug variant?
- starting palapeli with "DYLD_IMAGE_SUFFIX=_debug" doesn't help
